### About me:
___My main goal___ is to develop every day and try to learn something new.   
I am a fast learner, I understand mathematics and other analytical sciences well, but like any person I tend to be lazy.    
I graduated from a technical university as an engineer, worked for two years at a factory. I don't have programming experience yet, but I'd be glad to get it.

### Skills: 
HTML/CSS, JS, Git, Figma, VS Code - _(beginner)_.

### Code example:
  ```
  function century(year) {  
      let y = year % 100  
      if (y != 0) {  
        return((year / 100 - y /100)+1)  
      } else {  
        return(year / 100 )  
      }  
     }
   ```  

### Experience: 
Not yet. Only learning.
